Hi there!

In order to use the tiling functionality in Pixul Physics,
please use this custom shader that allows for sprite tiling.

It's basically an edited version of the Sprites/Default shader with
some added code to support tiling sprites.

Feel free to have a peek inside to see how it works.

Thanks!

The Pixul Guys.
